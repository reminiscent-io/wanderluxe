# Fix for Reservation Insertion Issue

## Problem Analysis
The reservation insertion is failing because the RLS (Row Level Security) policy is trying to check `user_has_edit_permission(trip_id)` but the reservations table may not have a direct `trip_id` column, or the permission function isn't working correctly.

## Solution
Run the `comprehensive_reservation_fix.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor. This script:

1. **Adds missing trip_id column** to reservations table if it doesn't exist
2. **Populates existing records** with correct trip_id values
3. **Creates proper foreign key constraints**
4. **Implements fallback RLS policies** if the permission function is missing
5. **Handles both ownership and sharing scenarios**

## Steps to Fix

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** â†’ **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire contents of `comprehensive_reservation_fix.sql`
3. Paste and execute the script
4. Test reservation creation

## What This Fixes
- Missing trip_id column in reservations table
- Incorrect RLS policy references
- Permission function dependencies
- Sharing permission checks

## Enhanced Error Logging
I've also added detailed error logging to the reservation form. After running the SQL fix, any remaining issues will show detailed error messages in the browser console.
